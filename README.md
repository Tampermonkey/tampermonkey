Beneath of other tags, functions and features the following ones are supported:
 - full unsafeWindow access
 - all GM_* functions including (GM_registerMenuCommand, GM_getResourceText, GM_getResourceURL, GM_notification)

DEPENDENCIES:

Google Chrome or Chromium 17 or higher

BASIC BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

- install Google Chrome or Chromium
- install Cygwin when using Windows
- open a konsole/terminal, and type:

cd
svn checkout http://tampermonkey.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tampermonkey-read-only
cd tampermonkey-read-only
ln -s build_sys/mkcrxfolder.sh .
./mkcrxfolder.sh -e0

Depending on your installed browser and OS (I hope this makes the overall scheme clear ;)

chrome.exe --pack-extension=rel/
chromium.exe --pack-extension=rel/

coogle-chrome --pack-extension=rel/
chromium-browser --pack-extension=rel/

ls -la now shows two new files:

-rw-r--r--  1 user user 305170 Aug 29 09:09 rel.crx
-rw-r--r--  1 user user    916 Aug 29 09:09 rel.pem

rel.crx is the Chrome extension, rel.pem the key to create another Tampermonkey extension file with the same extension ID

You can install rel.crx by drag'n'drop or (depending on your OS)

chrome.exe rel.crx
chromium.exe rel.crx

coogle-chrome rel.crx
chromium-browser rel.crx
